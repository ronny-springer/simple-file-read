# simple file read
Simple file read based on W3Cs File API code example and specification.
Crafted as a coding dojo result, it is required to read files (<2GB) from local environment asynchronously
and states named 'wait', 'progress', 'done', 'pause', 'cancel' und 'fail' have to be considered.
Production code have to be tested by JavaScript unit tests (Mocha, Chai).
